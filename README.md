# Readable
This project was developed for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project was to develop from scratch a `React` Application, using `React-Redux` for state management.

# Installing and launching the project:
- download this repository
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
- make sure to repeat those steps for the [backend server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/tree/master/api-server) as well

# Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with `Create React App`. You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
